# Rules Summary

**ABILITIES** <br>
**STR:** Physicality, brawn & toughness.
<br>**DEX:** Speed, sneaking & precision.
<br>**CTRL:**  Willpower, charm & weird.

**SAVES**
Roll d20 equal to or under target Ability. The party at most risk in a contested action  makes the save.

**HIT PROTECTION** <br>
**HP** reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage (both from damage and stress).

**HEALING**
<br>A quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

**DEPRIVATION**
<br>**Deprived** keeps a PC from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to a PCs inventory. **Fatigue** takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times

**INVENTORY**
<br>PCs have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.

**MAGIC**
<br> A new spell is created each morning. It is random or is a copy of one the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell. If deprived or in danger, a CTRL save may be required to avoid dire consequences.

**ACTIONS**
<br>On their turn, characters may move 40ft and take a single action. Actions are casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable action. These take place simultaneously.

**Retreating** from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.

For the **Start of Combat** round, characters must pass an DEX save in order to act.
Subsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.

**COMBAT**
<br>All attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their **Stress** or **Damage** die, subtract any protections from **Armor** (damage) or **Stability** (stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess damage is dealt to STR and excess stress is dealt to CTRL.

If there are **Multiple attackers**, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. **Impaired** attacks (position of weakness) reduce damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. **Enhanced** attacks (position of advantage) increase damage die to 1d12. **Blast** affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**
<br>Damage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death**; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 they are lost.

**STRESS & FALLOUT**
<br> Player chooses from the [Stress Fallout](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/) table when either:
- A PC takes critical stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)

<br> Each Stress Fallout entry:
- Can only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).
- Consumes an inventory slot.

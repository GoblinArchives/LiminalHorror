# Party Questions

## The Party
Why has the party come together? Use the answers from the Get To Know Your Character section to inform your decision. As a table create your own or use the table below (d6):

|   |                                                                                                                         |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | The investigators meet in a diner. They may or may not know each other. Fluorescent lights hum over checkered linoleum. |
| 2 | A simple “wrong place, wrong time.” The resulting event binds the investigators together.                               |
| 3 | United through self guided research. Online paranatural forum? Club? Support group?                                     |
| 4 | A mysterious patron that has brought the investigators together.                                                        |
| 5 | Members of the community respond to a series of mysterious events.                                                      |
| 6 | Investigators (either professional or amateur) that are looking into an event.                                          |


## Character Bonds (optional)
Have each player state a relationship to another character at the table. This should be informed by the background, The Abyss Stares Back, and The Party section of character creation. Some examples are:

|   |                                                              |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | _____ is hiding something from me.                           |
| 2 | _____ is my ex.                                              |
| 3 | _____ saved me from whatever it was that tried to attack me. |
| 4 | _____ is my drinking buddy                                   |
| 5 | _____ is my co-worker at _____                              |
| 6 | _____ is my neighbor.                                        |


## Vehicles
Determine as a group what types of vehicle or transportation the party has access to. The party may have access to more than one vehicle. Car chases are an essential part of solving a mystery.
Vehicles have HP. When it is reduced to 0HP it is totaled. Totaling a vehicle can cause damage to those in and around the vehicle.

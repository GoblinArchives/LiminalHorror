There is a lot of official and community support for Liminal Horror. Enough that we maintain **The Liminal Horror Library** ([https://liminalhorrorlibrary.com/](https://liminalhorrorlibrary.com/)) to cataolgue all the different resources out there (we currently have over 150).

Not only is there strong community support, but as a development team we are regularly putting out official content.

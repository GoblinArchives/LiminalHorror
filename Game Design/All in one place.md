# The Annotated Archive of Game Design Resources
A cataloged archive of different resources to demystify the steps that go into creating, publishing, and selling ttrpg products.

## What is The Annotated Archives?
Curated by Goblin Archives, this site's goal is to lower the barrier of entry for designers. It brings together twitter threads, blogs and youtube videos.

Cataloging these resources aims to demystify the design process. The push to open practice helps support the community. The Archives is a place that makes these practices easy to find.

## Where to start (a great overview)
- [Making An RPG Zine Start To Finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VSdmLw6bk&ab_channel=NateTreme) by the [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/) (Nate Treme). This is a fantastic overview of how to make a zine, especially since it guides the viewer through within the context of an actual ttrpg zine over its 4 and a half minutes runtime.
- [Digital Zinemaking Basics: A Guide by Zeshio](https://www.zeshio.com/blog/2021/8/28/digital-zinemaking-basics-a-guide-by-zeshio) is a fantastic overview to making a zine from start to fnish (through 8 detailed steps), guiding the reader through the process of developing Adventurer's Guide to the Yol'Najj Forest as the framing.
- **Markdown** is increasingly being a format that designers are using when writing. I find it really helpful in both the process and what it allows me to do (output in epub, html, and this website). Two great resources that are also included below are [Luke Gearing's "Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free"](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) and [Nate Treme's Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme). I think it is definitely worth looking into as a tool to use when designing.
- [5 Tips for Making Money in TTRPGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXeEbDBWbS0&ab_channel=JohnBattle) by John Battle is a great overview about how they got to where they are currently (both their games and channel are top tier).
- [Designing a tabletop rpg: day 1 - laying groundwork](https://www.haveyouplayedthis.com/posts/designing-an-rpg-e1) by Adam Bell is the start of a video series that has Adam making their practice visible as they design a ttrpg called Promise the Moon.

## Writing Adventures for Liminal Horror
A major aim of the Liminal Horror community is to support new writer/creators/facilitators in making things for Liminal Horror. We've collected resources specific to Liminal Horror in [Adventure Writing Resources](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/Adventure%20Writing%20Resources/).

## HACKS AND SRDS

### So you want to make a game but are unsure about writing rules from scratch (also a note on writing modules/adventures/mysteries using existing systems)….
Well great news! Many games live their lives as hacks for other games/rule systems. This means that you can start with a framework from which you can adapt to serve your idea/concept.

**SRD (System Reference Documents)** is a way game designers share their work. Often it includes what can be used, and how, so that other designers can iterate and create new games.

Below are some examples of different SRDs that you can use as a starting point in designing your own game. Many games have an SRD, but the one’s I’ve included have robust communities around them and are versatile enough to meet a myriad of needs.

Games have different licenses that dictate what can be used from the core text. Be sure to check their use/licenses to make sure you meet the requirements in your final product (an inclusions of established statements, attributions, etc).

[A Step-by-Step Guide to creating a TTRPG SRD](https://gist.github.com/Gulluth/447fe732d9681685ab01d7c512376b73) by Desolate Drifter ([@GulluthGultch](https://twitter.com/GulluthGulch)) is a comprehensve guide to creating your very ownn TTRPG SRD (that is also free).

### Example SRDs
- [**Liminal Horror**](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal-Horror-SRD/) by Goblin Archives: A rules lite modern cosmic horror hack of Cairn (which combines Into the Odd and Knave). It adds a stress & critcal stress fallout mechanic to those systems.
- [**Cairn**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/) by Yochai Gal. It is an adventure game where players explore dark and mysterious woods. It is based on Into the Odd and Knave.
- [**Vaults of Vaarn**](https://vaarn.github.io/#/) by Leo Hunt (with SRD by Desolate Drifter) is a techo filled game of a dying sun over a blue desert of science fantasy adventures.
- **[CY_BORG](https://morkborg.com/cb-license/)** by Christian Sahlen and Johan Nohr. This is a nano-infested doomsday RPG frames cybernetic misfits and punks as they rebel against corporate hell.
- **[MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/content/)** by Pelle Nilsson and Johan Nohr is a heavy metal inspired apocalyptic dark fantasy RPG.
- [**Beak, Feather, & Bone**](https://possible-worlds-games.itch.io/bfb-srd) by Tyler Crumrine. This rule framework is one that involves building a world through collaborative map making.
- [**24XX**](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) by Jason Tocci is a framework of rules that works as a modular plug-and-play toolkit. Rules lite and dynamic, 24XX SRD is axtremely versitile and includes a plethora of templates and resources to help designers get started.
- [**Tunnel Goons**](https://tunnelgoons.com/srd) by Nate Treme. Tunnel Goons is an extremely straightforward system that fits on half of a page.
- [**Forged in the Dark**](https://bladesinthedark.com/basics) by John Harper is the framework that allows you to makes games powered by Blades In The Dark
- [**Trophy**](https://trophyrpg.com/system/) by Jesse Ross. Trophy is a narrative system that focuses on the doom that befalls the characters. Beware the horror and doom that awaits.
- [**Wretched & Alone**](https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/wretched-alone-srd) by Matt Sanders & Chris Bissette. These are solo journaling games that focuse on struggle, survival, and striving to achieve.
- [**ARCANUM**](https://arc-rpg.com/arcanum?__s=n5rxcw9oizo8ivnlxqm6) by momatoes is a great example of an SRD that provides you with the tools to make a game using the SRD. In momatoes own words "If you want to make a creature codex based on ‘90s Variety Children Shows gone wrong, Spells & Techniques for a cyberpunk setting, or a rules modification for games running only an hour long, it’s now Legally Blessed (™)  if you read and follow the common-sense guidelines from the" [ARC RPG license](https://arc-rpg.com/license).

For a robust list of SRDs, [The TTRPG Creator Resources Masterpost](https://starshinescribbles.com/ttrpg-resources-masterpost/#Systemsandsrd) by Jonathon Greenall has a list of 60+ SRDs.

**Note:** Sometimes you don't want to write a hack or new game and instead want to write an adventure, mystery, or modul. Luckily all the advice in this guide still works for that. SRDs are still great because they can provide rules references that you can use to make your zine compatible.

**Writing Adventures for Liminal Horror**: A major aim of the Liminal Horror community is to support new writer/creators/facilitators in making things for Liminal Horror. We've collected resources specific to Liminal Horror in [Adventure Writing Resources](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/Adventure%20Writing%20Resources/).

## PROGRAMS

### What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.
- [Free Graphic Design Resources & Best Practices For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/free-graphic-design-resources-and-best-practices-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This post gives a great overview of the different aspects of design (from programs you can use, to different ways of building your skils, to important things to consider when working with others' work).
- [Resources for Free Creation Tools](https://itch.io/c/1832904/resources-for-free-creation-tools) by G. Raven Image is a collection of tools housed on itch.io that can help in various aspects of the writing, designing, and publishing process.

### Markdown
I've found myself writing my games using markdown (an easy to use computer language) that can be used with a variety of different programs, and allows you to output in multiple formats (pdf, epub, html). This increases your ability to create dynamic and accessible products down the line.
- [Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) by Luke Gearing is a fantastic step by step guide on how to write in markdown and then publish the results in multiple formats.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a super easy to learn writing program that I use regualrly. When paired with [pandoc](https://support.typora.io/Install-and-Use-Pandoc/) it gives you a lot of built in output options as well. It is what I used to write and publish the [Liminal Horror epub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10f8Q4jC3yQdbTUKx1DqIaHXEkdBWw-Cg/view?usp=sharing) (with some minor backend editing in calibre).
- [Zine Month 2022 Contribution - How to use Markdown and Pandoc to publish zines.](https://underwaterowlbear.blot.im/zine-month-2022-contribution-how-to-use-markdown-and-pandoc-to-publish-zines) is a fantastic guide in how to use markdown (and the pandoc extension) to publish your zines. The end result is a printable booklet ready to be made into a zine (and a format that can easily be exported to epub).
- [Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme) by Nate Treme is a great overview of the type of unique projects that are possible with markdown. An HTML dungeon that you can post right onto itch.io!
- [Spongedown](https://ivanceras.github.io/spongedown/Spongedown.html) is a wraps of markdown that allows you to integrate interesting diagrams, shapes, graphs, flowcharts, comics into your work.
- [Svgbob](https://ivanceras.github.io/svgbob-editor/) is a diagramming model that lets you create shaped in your markdown files.
- [mermaid - Markdownish syntax for generating flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, gantt charts and git graphs.](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

## Create your own SRD
Creating your own online SRD is not only a way to present your work (creating a free web based, public facing document that allows for collaboration and growth) but can help structure the writing and end product.
- [A Step-by-Step Guide to creating a TTRPG SRD](https://gist.github.com/Gulluth/447fe732d9681685ab01d7c512376b73) by Desolate Drifter [@GulluthGultch](https://twitter.com/GulluthGulch) is a comprehensve guide to creating your very ownn TTRPG SRD (that is also free).

### Character Sheets
- [How to Design TTRPG Sheets with Google Sheets](https://twitter.com/momatoes/status/1434902519335981065?s=20) by Momatoes is their guide on how to create a phenomenal and unique character sheet with google sheets.
- [Video Stream: teaching google sheets](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1139349790) by Momatoes takes you through the process of creating a character sheet like the one made for ARC.
- [Slide Deck: Google Sheets for fun, design, and games](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mj27yqx7kimxx2c/Google%20Sheets%20for%20fun%20design%20and%20games.pdf?dl=0) by Momatoes is the slide deck that was used in the stream and acts as a great reference.

### Word Processors/File Organization
- **Markdown** based programs such as [typora](https://typora.io/) or [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) are great options. I would highly recommend taking a little bit of time to learn about this option since it can really open up some opportunities at the end of your project.
- **Google Drive** for file organization & management. [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire) goes into detail about how one can leverage google docs to create a finished ttrpg. It presents what went well using gdocs, and what the drawbacks were.
- **Google Docs** for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a free website that really scaffolds small scale design in a way that allows anyone to create professional products. It is used a ton in teaching and other fields. A great overview by Jeeyon Shim, on how to use it in ttrpg spaces, can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20)

## EDITING
Editing is an important part of the design process but isn't always talked about. I hope to build out this entry into the archives with resources and support in understanding editing and its role.

### Dev vs Copy Editing

**Dev editing** (or developmental editing) happens during the writing process. It often gives input on structure, content and information design. It can lead to major overhauls in the end product. (I personally found this process super helpful in getting structural feedback on the text)

**Copyediting** (also called line editing) focuses on the language used and centers on polishing the writing. From errors to readability to consistency, this process makes the end product professional.

- [Tips for self editing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7VpDJFBZ-NB9FEHV77fM0W0Nf4g81yeej9NY7jx1zk/edit#heading=h.mxcn1tnxkqjl)

## Editing and The Mall

I was able to hire [Vi Huntsman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHjSosN7RjBiqPSdtE_VtAw) to do editing for The Mall. Initially I budgeted for copyediting.

After the first round, Vi noticed that there was a need for dev editing and we discussed adding dev editing time to the project. We were then able to pivot, doing two rounds of dev editing (and some resulting major restructuring). Afterwards Vi did a final round of copyediting for The Mall.

The below list includes every itchfunding version and corresponding notes (dev & copy) to archive the process. You can look to see what types of things get recommended in edits, and how they look when those notes get integrated into a text.
- [Here is a twitter thread detailing the process.](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives/status/1496377041201283072?s=20&t=v20idDPizCxs3w0p_yIlpw)

### The Mall's Editing Journey

1. **First Itchfunding Draft:** [The Mall v.0.75 itchfunding version (pre-Vi Huntsman Edits)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjUWF10X_A7bFcg5s9XgRB65SW4ZHYAmaar7Qf7ecmU/edit)
2. **Round 1 of Dev Edit Notes from Vi:** [Dev Edit Notes 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FgLxC98gWrwjzxehw9_5sKyHR5Yq9KRY/view?usp=sharing)

## Layout and Typeface

Having a good font and layout is vital toward making your game engaging to read/use. Here are some resources I found to help learn about layout/design.
- Johan Nohr (one of the designers of MÖRK BORG, which pushes the layout and typeface envelope) wrote two must read threads on choosing a typeface and setting a body text. These dives are worth reading if you have any interest in design and are a great way to start your journey.
  - [Choosing a typeface](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1275739369735929856?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr.
  - [Setting a body text](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1276532452627034112?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr.

## Layout
- [Designing Layouts (Layout and the Grid)](https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout) by Clayton Notestine. This was the single most helpful resource in my learning how to do layout for my game. Not only does Clayton go over the core concepts of layout, but he goes on to give annotated examples of TTRPGs and their layout. 100/10 recomend.

They look great and result in a quality that supports any new designer. Jeeyon is extremely thorough in their step by step guide in this thread. Well worth considering for your next project.

## Layout Templates

- **[Classic Explorer Starter Template](https://explorers.itch.io/classic-starter-template)** by Clayton Notestine is a fantastic template that aids in creating a clean, old-school style zine. "It's perfect for adventures, games, and campaigns in the style of *Cairne, Into the Odd,* and adventures like *The Isle, Silent Titans,* and *Deep Carbon Observatory.*"

- [Zero Budget Book Covers](https://loottheroom.uk/zero-budget-book-covers) by Loot the Room.


## COMMISSIONING WORK
If you are like me and not the most visual creative oriented, luckily there is a robust group of talented designers and artists out there. Often you will see them advertising that their commissions are open. Have a clear concept in mind as well as your budget range. Understand that commissioning work is a collaborative process between professionals and requires respect and clear communication.
- [A Commission Contract Template for Artists](https://jnbutlerart.itch.io/commission-contract-template) by J.N. Butler.

## COMMERCIALLY LICENSED ART
There are many artists that provide options to commerically license their art. Some use a flat purchase (on itch or another platform) while others provide licensing to those who subscribe to their patreon. Here are few that I have found:
- [Amanda Lee Franck's Comradery page](https://comradery.co/amandalee) puts out monthly access to amazing spot art.
- [Emo Sludge Royalty Free Spot Art Pack](https://emosludge.itch.io/spot-art) by Zach Hazard Vaupen is a pack of Royalty Free Spot Art for your game or zine

## PUBLIC DOMAIN IMAGES
For those of us who are not artists, or don't have a budget to commission art for our work, public domain images are what we use to add artwork to our games. These are images that are able to be used in commercial work (either because their copyright has lapsed, they are not copyrightable, or they were released under an open license from the start). Here are some places you can find art for your games.

## Formats
Different formats support different levels of accessability. when thinking about how one presents their work there are three major modes Web / EPUB / Print. Often when games are published the focus is only on print/pdf format. This is largely due to the fact that pdf is what is used to submit things for print. When thinking about accessiblity, understanding the scaffolds (and constraints) of the format is super important.
- [GIVING A DAMN ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY](https://accessibility.uxdesign.cc/) by Sheri Byrne-Haber is "a candid and practical handbook for designers." Its goal is to make sure that digital accessibility provides equal access to information, functionality and experience on digital platforms.
- [HTML and ePub ttrpg creation](https://jameschip.itch.io/html-and-epub-ttrpg-creation) by James Chip is a quick guide will introduce you to creating content for your ttrpg to publish in both html and ePub formats,using pandoc to create both outputs from a single file.
- [EPUBs for TTRPG Blog/How-to](https://root-devil.com/posts/epubs/) by Root Devil

## Accessibility & Design Intention
One of the big things I wanted when writing Liminal Horror was to push mystelf to find ways to support people's ability to access information. This largely arose from my background in teaching, and how it is important to provide multiple access points and opportunities for people to engage in the work.
- [Accessibility in Gaming Resource Guide By Jennifer Kretchmer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFSXz-Yva1KZAsP7NblCdkoiQ6RcjxSV2gj98eXusJs/edit) a guide full of resources that helps creators learn and implement accessiblity into their work. Sections include:
    - Essential Learning and Tools
    - Panel Discussions
    - Gaming Resources
    - Table and Game Accessibility Tools
    - Characters, Mechanics, and Worldbuilding
    - Tropes
    - Art and Design
    - Technology Tools
    - Events
    - Language
    - Supporting Disabled People
    - Further Learning
- [VAST](https://vast.guide/) VAST is a series of short articles aiming to spread awareness about visual impairments and their associated access requirements, followed by a series of guides that will help you to use accessibility tools in Adobe programs.

### ePub
There are a lot of benefits to creating epub versions of games. Text only games are able to be used with screen readers, and have boosted accessibility functions (fonts, font sizes, margins).
- [Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) by Luke Gearing is a fantastic step by step guide on how to write in markdown and then publish the results in multiple formats (epub/html/pdf).
- [Outputting multiple file formats with Pandoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4-SmBgT4Uc&t=5s&ab_channel=LootTheRoom) by Loot the Room is a great 13 minute video that shows an adventure being written on a phone and being able to have multiple output methods.
- [Accessible Publishing Best Practices: Guidelines for Common EPUB Issues in Plain Language](https://www.accessiblepublishing.ca/accessible-publishing-best-practices/) by the Canadian National Network for Equitable Library Service. This document lays out different variables to concider to support accessiblity in information design. The major points are to: add alt text, have clear information hierarchy, hyper-link with titles, and avoid complicated presentation.
- [Sean Patrick Cain](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1427356978872033285) had the initial twitter thread that went over step by step how he created a ePub version of his game Long Haul 1983.

## Licenses

An important step of creating is understanding licenses (if you are writing content for another game) or creating your own game (which may inspire others to write content for your game). There are different licensing options you can do, often with overlapping considerations. The two areas of focus I want to present as options for games that I see a lot in the indie-rpg scene, and those are Creative Commons Licensing (CC-BY-SA 4.0) and Third-Party Licensing.

Of note I am not a lawyer and this is by no means legal counsel.

### Creative Commons Licensing

- [Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International — CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) is a super permissive licensing language that allows others to share, sell, remix, transform, and build upon one's work. [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) by Yochai Gal and Liminal Horror (my game) are examples of games that have CC BY-SA-4.0. The main idea behind it is to make the works completely open for use by others (and therefore encourage games/hacks/adventure to be made for them).

### Third-Party License (Open Licenses)

Open Licenses (often referred to as 3PP/ 3rd Party License) allow others to create and publish compatible games. These licenses have stipulations that must be followed, and if they are then others can make original content while adhering to vision set out by the license. These licenses also stipulate what is open to be used (and what assets are not allowable for use by others).

- ([The Mörk Borg Third-Party License & You – Līber Lūdōrum (liberludorum.com)](https://liberludorum.com/2021/07/05/the-mork-borg-third-party-license-you/)) does a fantastic job of not only guiding the reader through the Mörk Borg Third-Party License but it details what a 3rd Party License can do.
- [MÖRK BORG LICENSE (morkborg.com)](https://morkborg.com/license/) is perhaps the most popular format of open license I found (especially when I put the call out about licensing how-tos). I found a lot of creators pointing to this license as the framework for creating their own licenses.
  - I was able to talk to Johan Nohr [(@JohanNohr) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr), one of the creators of Mörk Borg, about the idea behind creating a permissive  third-party license,  "in short, we wanted a license that was open, inviting and encouraged people to make and publish things. I don't think people necessarily -need- a license like this to make stuff, if they want to publish their own material they will, regardless - this I just our way to say loudly that we really want people to do that and we want to help them get their shit done."

-  [THE COMPANY by Mega_Corp (itch.io)](https://mega-corp.itch.io/the-company) by Logan Dean [(@L__Dean) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/L__Dean) is an example of a license that is based on the foundation laid out by Mörk Borg. It acts as a direct invitation for others to create content, while maintaining the vision of the original work.
- [Third Party Licence · Runecairn (byodinsbeardrpg.com)](https://runecairn.byodinsbeardrpg.com/licence/) by Colin Le Sueur - [(@ByOdinsBeardRPG) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/ByOdinsBeardRPG) is another example of a easy to parse Third-Party License. When asked about why he decided to make a license, he said, "Since I based it on Cairn, which has a CC BY-SA (share alike) licence, I'd already opened up Runecairn for editing and modifying, so a 3rd party licence just made sense. I wanted people to take my work and hack it, like I'd hacked Cairn. By adding a logo and giving explicit consent and encouragement, I hope people would build on Runecairn and make it their own. Selfishly it helps me as well, since more Runecairn adventures helps spread the word for the system and my work."

- [ARC CREATORS LICENSE](https://arc-rpg.com/license) by momatoes is a license for ARC that allows people to "ARC-compatible, -inspired and derived works for free or for sale without any fees or prior permission required" as long  as they follow the guidance laid out in the license.

In the end, you can publish a game without any custom licensing, but what is becoming more evident is for game designers, they see having an open and permissive Third-Party license as a invitation for others to create works for their games. It acts a way to bring people in and let them know what can be done with the works.

## Creative Comrades
Creative Comrades Licence is a new form of licensing agreement created by [jn](https://twitter.com/JNButlerArt) for use of their art in commerical products. It also is another model of a license worth building from.

## FUNDING
While you can write and create each aspect of your zine yourself, some parts may require funds to complete (either to make a reality or to commission someone to make). Some things that may require investment are:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are are a few different ways to raise funds for your game. A noncomprehensive list is:
- setting up a co-op
- slowfunding
- settig up pre-orders
- "crowdfunding" platforms (such as itchfunding or Gamefound).

### itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is the format I curretly am using to create [The Mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall).
- [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire). As with all the Jalopy Design entries, this one is extremely infomrative in providing a deep look at the benefits and drawbacks to itchfunding in the context of their project.
- [Information Thread: How To Setup Itchfunding!](https://twitter.com/PandionGames/status/1494418829610561536?s=20&t=zmv6zm7LLIMzcs6-3zLWbw) by Pandion Games is a fantastic 16 tweet thread that goes over the benefits and steps crowdfund using itchfunding.
- [Itchfund FAQ](https://itchfunding.games/#faq) by KeganExe is a great place to get an overview of what itchfunding is and what it can do.
PlusOneEXP hosted a great discussion on Itchfunding.
- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clNyEWtF1Yo&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Jeff Stormer
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FJiCCoe5c&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with KeganExe, Adam Bell, Nic Masyk
- [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpsOqZ4sAWU&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Thomas Manuel & Sam Leigh.
- [Google Doc compiling notes on the discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MW7uZ2LS2BHGA2bZlZ9LwgCSzVZAVhzeHF4crxtUeQU/edit#heading=h.s68hu2kptye4) by EldritchMouse.
- [The Mall itchfunding page](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall) is an example of an itchfunding page. I used a ton of different models and the above resources to try and structure it in a way that presented the necessary information to backers. You can use any parts of it (especially the Itchfunding & the Mall, The Goal, and the Logistics sections) in your own campaign.

### Presale Model
Another funding method being implemented is a pre-sale model
- [My Adventures In Selling Stuff Part 2: How I turned a free BigCartel shop into my personal crowdunding platform](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1445783558925086733?s=20) by Sean Patrick Cain is one twitter thread (in a fantastic series) that goes step by step in how to use the free version of BigCartel to make a pre-order funding platform.
- [Craigstarter](https://github.com/cmod/craigstarter) by Craig Mod is a free to us/edit/extend crowdfunding tool for Shopify.

### Slowfunding
Slowfunding is crowdfunding alternative proposed by Long Tail Games, that acts gradual model of colecting pre-orders over an extended period of time, and once it hit pre-determined markers then it triggers going into different stages of production.
- [Slowfund launch announcement for Lost Eons](https://twitter.com/Long_Tail_Games/status/1470729086850912257?s=20) goes into the idea behind slowfunding.
- [What is slowfunding?](https://cardboard.monster/pages/what-is-slowfunding)

### Printing Partnerships
One option is to partner with retailers to help fund a print run. Many online retailers do this (I have experience partnering with Exalted Funeral and Space Penguin Ink).

### Crowdfunding

## PRINTING and PUBLISHING

### Overview
- [A Year in RPG Self Publishing: Year 1](http://uncannyspheres.blogspot.com/2021/02/a-year-in-rpg-self-publishing-year-1.html) by Ian Yusem. This is a great peak behind the curtain on some of the realities of self publishing. Ian does a great job of consistantly opening their practice (and a few of their blog posts about Kickstarters are linked in the funding page).
- [**Zine or Pamplet?**](https://twitter.com/infinite_mao/status/1433500285318598657?s=20) The format you choose to present your writting will be a factor when trying to market your game. Jared Sinclair (bookseller for spearwitch, editor, and writer) wrote a great thread of the financial considerations to choosing your format.
- [My Adventures In Selling Stuff](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1450483990469742596?s=20) by Sean Patrick Cain is a fantastic series of twitter thread that detail Sean's journey in printing, selling, & shipping his book Long Haul 1983.
- [Publishing Costs & Budgeting, Sean McCoy](https://twitter.com/seanmccoy/status/1671948220065275905?s=46&t=t7cbk0iePa85f6_Ctf4G-g)

## Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).
- [Itch Game Page Image Guide and Templates](https://starwest.itch.io/itch-page-image-templates) by Star West is a great template to help promote your work on itch.io.
- [Itch Page Images Template](https://m-allen-hall.itch.io/aftemplate) by M. Allen Hall is an Artboard Template for Affinity Designer.
- [Better Creator Pages](https://comigo.itch.io/better-creator-pages) by Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych.
- [Itch graphic templates](https://jannikboysen.itch.io/easy-releasy) by Jannik Boysen presents hassle free itch-graphic templates.

## Printing & Publishing (Yourself)
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.
- [So You Want to Make a Zine: Printing](https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) by Mazirian's Garden expands on the different ways you can print a zine (use a copy machine, print at home, print at a print shop, print through an online printer).
- [Indie Game Publishing Resources](https://lonearchivist.com/indie-game-publishing-resources) by Lone Archivist collects many different avenues you could use for getting your game into print.
- [The Printing Process Demystified For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/the-printing-process-demystified-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This helpful guide goes over the different aspects of printing.
- [ISBN Barcode Generator](https://kindlepreneur.com/isbn-bar-code-generator/) allows you to create ISBN barcodes for your products (which is necessary to be carried in many brick and mortar stores).

## Printing Options
There are a few different options in terms of printers that you can use. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but is a place to start.
- [Mixam](https://mixam.com/zines) is probably the most common/popular way to print physical ttrpg zines.
- [Tabletop Hotdish](https://twitter.com/TabletopHotdish/status/1456727136761524235?s=20) is a newer small business printer who has been working with indie zine publishers (and does free print proofs). Currently they are launching a full website, but dm on twitter to see about starting a partnership.
- [short Run Printing](https://www.shortrunprinting.com/)
- [Jukebox](https://www.jukeboxprint.com/booklets) is another web based printer that offers a ton of different formats (stickers, booklets, brochures, etc). Often seen as a good mixam alternative.
- [Spencer Printing](http://spencerprinting.com/) offers both offset & digital printing, as well as short-run book printing.
- [Taylor Specialty Books](http://taylorspecialtybooks.com/)
- [Smartpress](https://smartpress.com/)
- [Pet Riso Studio](https://www.petrisostudio.com/) is a US based risograph printer.
- [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/sell/sell-on-lulu) allows you to upload your print files and sell print on demand either through their platform or your own store.

## Publishing Partnerships
One option for funding a print run is to partner with a publisher/distributor. Many indie storefronts regularly partner with game writers to get a finished game to print. This tends to involve a partnership where the store fronts some (or all) of the cost to print. Afterwards they handle distribution, and after the print costs are recouped they pay regular royalties to the game's designer. This is the avenue I went through for Liminal Horror (I had it published through Exalted Funeral Press).
- If publishing it yourself is out of reach (logistically or financially), it is worthwhile to reach out to one of the great small ttrpg retailers listed below. Sometimes all it takes is emailing the right person to make a connection that can help you get into print.


## Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.
- [Setting up Shopify for Wholesale](https://pandiongames.notion.site/Setting-up-Shopify-Wholesale-88000e81e0654ad798de5245f427649e) by Pandiongames.

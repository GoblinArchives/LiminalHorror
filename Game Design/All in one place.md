# The Annotated Archive of Game Design Resources
Below is a collection of resources I found to help guide me through the process of becoming a game designer (who writes their own system, or writes adventures for different systems). It is not comprehensive, and is a living document. My hope is to continue to grow this resource so that others can benefit from the collective insight of the ttrpg/design community.

## Where to start (a great overview)
- [Making An RPG Zine Start To Finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_VSdmLw6bk&ab_channel=NateTreme) by the [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/) (Nate Treme). This is a fantastic overview of how to make a zine, especially since it guides the viewer through within the context of an actual ttrpg zine over its 4 and a half minutes runtime.
- [Digital Zinemaking Basics: A Guide by Zeshio](https://www.zeshio.com/blog/2021/8/28/digital-zinemaking-basics-a-guide-by-zeshio) is a fantastic overview to making a zine from start to fnish (through 8 detailed steps), guiding the reader through the process of developing Adventurer's Guide to the Yol'Najj Forest as the framing.
- **Markdown** is increasingly being a format that designers are using when writing. I find it really helpful in both the process and what it allows me to do (output in epub, html, and this website). Two great resources that are also included below are [Luke Gearing's "Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free"](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) and [Nate Treme's Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme). I think it is definitely worth looking into as a tool to use when designing.

## HACKS AND SRDS

### So you want to make a game but are unsure about writing rules from scratch (also a note on writing modules/adventures/mysteries using existing systems)….
Well great news! Many games live their lives as hacks for other games/rule systems. This means that you can start with a framework from which you can adapt to serve your idea/concept.

**SRD (System Reference Documents)** is a way game designers share their work. Often it includes what can be used, and how, so that other designers can iterate and create new games.

Below are some examples of different SRDs that you can use as a starting point in designing your own game. Many games have an SRD, but the one’s I’ve included have robust communities around them and are versatile enough to meet a myriad of needs.

Games have different licenses that dictate what can be used from the core text. Be sure to check their use/licenses to make sure you meet the requirements in your final product (an inclusions of established statements, attributions, etc).

[A Step-by-Step Guie to creating a TTRPG SRD](https://gist.github.com/Gulluth/447fe732d9681685ab01d7c512376b73) by Desolate Drifter [@GulluthGultch](https://twitter.com/GulluthGulch) is a comprehensve guide to creating your very ownn TTRPG SRD (that is also free).

### Example SRDs
- [**Liminal Horror**](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal-Horror-SRD/) by Goblin Archives: A rules lite modern cosmic horror hack of Cairn (which combines Into the Odd and Knave). It adds a stress & critcal stress fallout mechanic to those systems.
- [**Cairn**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/) by Yochai Gal. It is an adventure game where players explore dark and mysterious woods. It is based on Into the Odd and Knave.
- [Vaults of Vaarn] by Leo Hunt (with SRD by Desolate Drifter) is a techo filled game of a dying sun over a blue desert of science fantasy adventures.
- [**PINKHACK**](https://monkeys-paw-games.itch.io/pinkhack-srd) by Monkey's Paw Games. Rules for Fantastic Role-Playing Wargames, Monkey's Paw Games has created a combination of the Whitehack and into the Odd.
- [**Beak, Feather, & Bone**](https://possible-worlds-games.itch.io/bfb-srd) by Tyler Crumrine. This rule framework is one that involves building a world through collaborative map making.
- [**24XX**](https://jasontocci.itch.io/24xx) by Jason Tocci is a framework of rules that works as a modular plug-and-play toolkit. Rules lite and dynamic, 24XX SRD is axtremely versitile and includes a plethora of templates and resources to help designers get started.
- [**Tunnel Goons**](https://tunnelgoons.com/srd) by Nate Treme. Tunnel Goons is an extremely straightforward system that fits on half of a page.
- [**Trophy**](https://trophyrpg.com/system/) by Jesse Ross. Trophy is a narrative system that focuses on the doom that befalls the characters. Beware the horror and doom that awaits.
- [**Wretched & Alone**](https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/wretched-alone-srd) by Matt Sanders & Chris Bissette. These are solo journaling games that focuse on struggle, survival, and striving to achieve.

**Note:** Sometimes you don't want to write a hack or new game and instead want to write an adventure, mystery, or modul. Luckily all the advice in this guide still works for that. SRDs are still great because they can provide rules references that you can use to make your zine compatible. I wrote a small twitter thread on the different supports Liminal Horror provides for people who are wanting to write their own mysteries/sessions/adventures. That can be found here: [Interested in writing cosmic horror adventures?](https://twitter.com/goblin_archives/status/1430923992097984514?s=20)

## PROGRAMS

### What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.
- [Free Graphic Design Resources & Best Practices For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/free-graphic-design-resources-and-best-practices-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This post gives a great overview of the different aspects of design (from programs you can use, to different ways of building your skils, to important things to consider when working with others' work).
- [Resources for Free Creation Tools](https://itch.io/c/1832904/resources-for-free-creation-tools) by G. Raven Image is a collection of tools housed on itch.io that can help in various aspects of the writing, designing, and publishing process.

## Create your own SRD
Creating your own online SRD is not only a way to present your work (creating a free web based, public facing document that allows for collaboration and growth) but can help structure the writing and end product.
- [A Step-by-Step Guie to creating a TTRPG SRD](https://gist.github.com/Gulluth/447fe732d9681685ab01d7c512376b73) by Desolate Drifter [@GulluthGultch](https://twitter.com/GulluthGulch) is a comprehensve guide to creating your very ownn TTRPG SRD (that is also free).

## Markdown
I've found myself writing my games using markdown (an easy to use computer language) that can be used with a variety of different programs, and allows you to output in multiple formats (pdf, epub, html).
- [Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) by Luke Gearing is a fantastic step by step guide on how to write in markdown and then publish the results in multiple formats.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a super easy to learn writing program that I use regualrly. When paired with [pandoc](https://support.typora.io/Install-and-Use-Pandoc/) it gives you a lot of built in output options as well. It is what I used to write and publish the [Liminal Horror epub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10f8Q4jC3yQdbTUKx1DqIaHXEkdBWw-Cg/view?usp=sharing) (with some minor backend editing in calibre).
- [Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme) by Nate Treme is a great overview of the type of unique projects that are possible with markdown. An HTML dungeon that you can post right onto itch.io!

### Character Sheets
- [How to Design TTRPG Sheets with Google Sheets](https://twitter.com/momatoes/status/1434902519335981065?s=20) by Momatoes is their guide on how to create a phenomenal and unique character sheet with google sheets.
  - [Video Stream: teaching google sheets](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1139349790) by Momatoes takes you through the process of creating a character sheet like the one made for ARC.
  - [Slide Deck: Google Sheets for fun, design, and games](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mj27yqx7kimxx2c/Google%20Sheets%20for%20fun%20design%20and%20games.pdf?dl=0) by Momatoes is the slide deck that was used in the stream and acts as a great reference.

### Word Processors/File Organization
- **Markdown** based programs such as [typora](https://typora.io/) or [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) are great options. I would highly recommend taking a little bit of time to learn about this option since it can really open up some opportunities at the end of your project.
- **Google Drive** for file organization & management. [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire) goes into detail about how one can leverage google docs to create a finished ttrpg. It presents what went well using gdocs, and what the drawbacks were.
- **Google Docs** for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program (currently $54.99)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a free website that really scaffolds small scale design in a way that allows anyone to create professional products. It is used a ton in teaching and other fields. A great overview by Jeeyon Shim, on how to use it in ttrpg spaces, can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20)
- [Top 15 Tutorials](https://designshack.net/articles/reviews/affinity-publisher-tutorials-reviews/). Affinity has a bunch of helpful tutorials to lower the learning curve and this had some good ones included.
- [Tips for adding interactivity to your digital publications](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/tips-for-adding-interactivity-to-your-digital-publications/?fbclid=IwAR23JilQaxht5L6I3E86vihJwhO9kOTYo0Nd7fZrbv2w0y55zbqFcQm-Gjg)

### Image Editing & Creation
[Jalopy Design: Cleaning up Public Domain Art](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/09/JalopyFreeArt) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire) does another fantastic entry that goes through how to edit and leverage Public Domain Art in your works.

- [GIMP](www.gimp.org) is a free, open source image editor. While I do own Affinity Designer and Photo, I still primarily use this to edit the images I used in Liminal Horror.
- [PIXLR X](https://pixlr.com/x/) Is a free browser based photo editor. Described as an easy-to-use photo editor (with help of templates)
- [PIXLR E](https://pixlr.com/e/) Is a free browser based, powerful photo editor. Described as an advanced editor for pros.
- [Dither Me This](https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/) is a tool you can use to dither images.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free vector graphic program.
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a free open source painting program.
- [Artflow AI](http://artflow.ai/) allows users to generate visual content wit hthe help of an AI. Currently it is built to generate portraits. The output is licensed under CC BY which allows commercial and noncommercial use with attribution.

Here is a list of alternatives to Adobe programs created by [xdaniel Art](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt) (they require a regular subscription that is predatory and if you don't pay you often get hit with massive hidden fees and lose access to things you have made/bought) <br>
[![A list of alternatives to each of Adobe's products.](/LiminalHorror/img/programs.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="75%" width="75%"}](/LiminalHorror/img/programs.png)

## LAYOUT and FONTS
Having a good font and layout is vital toward making your game engaging to read/use. Here are some resources I found to help learn about layout/design.
- Johan Nohr (one of the designers of MÖRK BORG, which pushes the layout and typeface envelope) wrote two must read threads on choosing a typeface and setting a body text. These dives are worth reading if you have any interest in design and are a great way to start your journey.
  - [Choosing a typeface](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1275739369735929856?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr.
  - [Setting a body text](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1276532452627034112?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr.

### Layout
- [Designing Layouts (Layout and the Grid)](https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout) by Clayton Notestine. This was the single most helpful resource in my learning how to do layout for my game. Not only does Clayton go over the core concepts of layout, but he goes on to give annotated examples of TTRPGs and their layout. 100/10 recomend.
- [Layout Design Tips For Your Next TTRPG Project](https://ghostlorestudios.com/layout-design-tips-for-your-next-ttrpg-project/) by Ghost Lore. This is the final entry in a series that gives a good progression of layout tips that is well worth reading prior to starting the layout of your project.
- [Why Is Layout Important in Graphic Design?](https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/why-is-layout-important-in-graphic-design) by Stephanie Corrigan is a great overview of layout prinicples with visual examples to reinforce concepts.
- [Using Canva to layout your ttrpg](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20) by Jeeyon Shim is a fantastic thread on how to leverage a great design tool to create small games. They look great and result in a quality that supports any new designer. Jeeyon is extremely thorough in their step by step guide in this thread. Well worth considering for your next project.
- [Pamplet RPG Template For Affinity Publisher](https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/wtf-pamphlet-rpg-template-affinity-publisher) by wizardthieffighter (writer of the awe inspiring Ultra Violet Grasslands). This template will get you all set up for writnig your own pamphlet using Affinity Publisher (a great single payment layout software...Adobe makes you pay monthly)
- **Pinterest**: Look up layout, design, zines on pinterest to see examples of different design ideas you can use. This helps build visual references for the kind of things that are possible.
- [My pinterest board](https://pin.it/1OIQmGq).
- [TTRPG Zine Layouts](https://pin.it/42u4uaC) by Guilherme Gontijo.
- [Designs that could be TTRPGS](https://www.pinterest.com/gontijodesign/ttrpg-zines-could-look-like-this/?invite_code=9aa2c221ccca41069445ba3e84693972&sender=478578035310725364) by Guilherme Gontijo

### Typography & Fonts
- [Typography in Ten Minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html), by Matthew Buttericks is a great resource for building your schema and dipping your toes into that world.
- [Summary of key rules](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html) is another great introductory resource by Matthew Buttericks.
- [Free fonts](https://twitter.com/gontijodesign/status/1394624373823348737?s=27) compiled as a twitter thread by Guilherme Gontijo.
- [Coding with Character](https://realdougwilson.com/writing/coding-with-character) by Doug Wilson. This blog is about utilizing different fonts for coding and could easily be applicable when thinking about what typeface to use for your project (especially if monospaced type aligns to the aesthetic of your project). Be sure to check the licensing of any fonts you are interested in to make sure they are available for commercial use.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Display) is a collection of fonts released under open source licenses.
- [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) is another place to search for fonts and includes easy to find licensing information.

## IMAGES

## CREATING YOUR OWN
One option is to design your own images. There are a few different programs you can use ([some are listed here](#programs)) to make your own maps and images. There are some online tools that allow you to create maps for your adventures. Always be sure to check the licensing information of resources you use.
- [Perplexing Ruins Hex Map Tile Set!](https://perplexingruins.itch.io/perplexing-ruins-hex-kit-tiles) by Perlexing Ruins is a fantastic tile set that is made available for use through donations. It provides assets for [Hex Kit Software](https://cone.itch.io/hex-kit)
- [Dungeon Scrawl](https://dungeonscrawl.com/docs/#/) by ProbableTrain is a map making software that supports you in creating [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## COMMISSIONING WORK
If you are like me and not the most visual creative oriented, luckily there is a robust group of talented designers and artists out there. Often you will see them advertising that their commissions are open. Have a clear concept in mind as well as your budget range. Understand that commissioning work is a collaborative process between professionals and requires respect and clear communication.

## COMMERCIALLY LICENSED ART
There are many artists that provide options to commerically license their art. Some use a flat purchase (on itch or another platform) while others provide licensing to those who subscribe to their patreon. Here are few that I have found:
- [Evelyn Moreu](https://www.patreon.com/evlynmoreau) has a Patreon that contains some of the best art that she allows you to use commercially in your zines (if you subscribe).
- [Perplexing Ruins](https://www.patreon.com/perplexingruins) also has a patreon that provides access to images that can be commercially licensed through a subscription.
- [Andy's Inventory Art Pak #1](https://andyanimates.itch.io/andys-inventory-1) by Andrew White is a collection of 81 random inventory items that can purchased to use uder a CC BY 4.0.
- [Tiny Zine of Faces #1](https://punkpadour.itch.io/tiny-zine-of-faces-1) as well as [Tiny Zine of Faces #2](https://punkpadour.itch.io/tiny-zine-of-faces-2) by Chema (Punkpadour) contain some fantastic portraits and images that can be purchased to be used commercally.
- [Feral Indie Studio](https://itch.io/s/44997/zimo-2022-artpack) sells themed art packs that can be used commerically.
- [Fantasy Art 01](https://hairic.itch.io/hairic-rpg-assets-fantasy-pack-01) by Hairic Lilred is a collection of fantasy art assets that can be used commerically.
- [Map Pieces](https://mapcrow.itch.io/map-pieces) by Map Crow includes different pieces that can be used to make maps (and are Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licesed).

## PUBLIC DOMAIN IMAGES
For those of us who are not artists, or don't have a budget to commission art for our work, public domain images are what we use to add artwork to our games. These are images that are able to be used in commercial work (either because their copyright has lapsed, they are not copyrightable, or they were released under an open license from the start). Here are some places you can find art for your games.

[Jalopy Design: Cleaning up Public Domain Art](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/09/JalopyFreeArt) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire) does another fantastic entry that goes through how to edit and leverage Public Domain Art in your works.

- [Public Domain Art List by Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/public-domain-art) is an extensive list of public domain images and the different places you find public domain art.
- [A flickr collection of curated Public Domain Images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192445357@N05/galleries) by Guilherme Gontijo.

## ACCESSIBILITY AND DESIGN INTENTION
One of the big things I wanted when writing Liminal Horror was to push mystelf to find ways to support people's ability to access information. This largely arose from my background in teaching, and how it is important to provide multiple access points and opportunities for people to engage in the work.
- [Tips for adding interactivity to your digital publications](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/tips-for-adding-interactivity-to-your-digital-publications/?fbclid=IwAR23JilQaxht5L6I3E86vihJwhO9kOTYo0Nd7fZrbv2w0y55zbqFcQm-Gjg)
- [Making Your Game Accessible Is Easy by Nate Lee](https://sessionprep.wordpress.com/2021/07/22/making-your-game-accessible-is-easy-i-promise-2/?fbclid=IwAR2sB_U2uZuWPGtgRyH37Ktj-5YHaQWQt1GJSOlhlRXDoLK4pm1cnwd37mE)

### ePub
There are a lot of benefits to creating epub versions of games. Text only games are able to be used with screen readers, and have boosted accessibility functions (fonts, font sizes, margins). Two recent (as of August 2021) twitter threads have gone over how to create ePub documents. There will be a Liminal Horror Epub available for free in the near future (or past depending on when this is read).
- [Sean Patrick Cain](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1427356978872033285) had the initial twitter thread that went over step by step how he created a ePub version of his game Long Haul 1983.
- [Peter Eijk](https://twitter.com/JimmyShelter/status/1428439348417073159) created a followup thread to talk about how one can create accessible tables in ePubs using html.

## PRINTING and PUBLISHING

### Overview
- [A Year in RPG Self Publishing: Year 1](http://uncannyspheres.blogspot.com/2021/02/a-year-in-rpg-self-publishing-year-1.html) by Ian Yusem. This is a great peak behind the curtain on some of the realities of self publishing. Ian does a great job of consistantly opening their practice (and a few of their blog posts about Kickstarters are linked in the funding page).
- [**Zine or Pamplet?**](https://twitter.com/infinite_mao/status/1433500285318598657?s=20) The format you choose to present your writting will be a factor when trying to market your game. Jared Sinclair (bookseller for spearwitch, editor, and writer) wrote a great thread of the financial considerations to choosing your format.
- [My Adventures In Selling Stuff](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1450483990469742596?s=20) by Sean Patrick Cain is a fantastic series of twitter thread that detail Sean's journey in printing, selling, & shipping his book Long Haul 1983.

### Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).

### Printing & Publishing
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.
- [So You Want to Make a Zine: Printing](https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) by Mazirian's Garden expands on the different ways you can print a zine (use a copy machine, print at home, print at a print shop, print through an online printer).
- [Indie Game Publishing Resources](https://lonearchivist.com/indie-game-publishing-resources) by Lone Archivist collects many different avenues you could use for getting your game into print.
- [The Printing Process Demystified For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/the-printing-process-demystified-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This helpful guide goes over the different aspects of printing.

## Printing Options
There are a few different options in terms of printers that you can use. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but is a place to start.
- [Mixam](https://mixam.com/zines) is probably the most common/popular way to print physical ttrpg zines.
- [Tabletop Hotdish](https://twitter.com/TabletopHotdish/status/1456727136761524235?s=20) is a newer small business printer who has been working with indie zine publishers (and does free print proofs). Currently they are launching a full website, but dm on twitter to see about starting a partnership.
- [short Run Printing](https://www.shortrunprinting.com/)
- [Jukebox](https://www.jukeboxprint.com/booklets) is another web based printer that offers a ton of different formats (stickers, booklets, brochures, etc). Often seen as a good mixam alternative.
- [Spencer Printing](http://spencerprinting.com/) offers both offset & digital printing, as well as short-run book printing.
- [Taylor Specialty Books](http://taylorspecialtybooks.com/)
- [Smartpress](https://smartpress.com/)

## Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.
- [Starting Guide to Pricing](https://twitter.com/infinite_mao/status/1394367298601947136?s=20) by Jared Sinclair (bookseller for spearwitch) gives you a good idea of a starting point for pricing physical copies of your game.

## MARKETING
Here are two great resources on marketing your game, especially when starting out.

## FUNDING
While you can write and create each aspect of your zine yourself, some parts may require funds to complete (either to make a reality or to commission someone to make). Some things that may require investment are:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are are a few different ways to raise funds for your game. There is:
- setting up a co-op
- slowfunding
- settig up pre-orders
- "crowd funding" platforms (such as itchfunding or Gamefound).

### itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is the format I curretly am using to create [The Mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall).

As with all the Jalopy Design entries, this one is extremely infomrative in providing a deep look at the benefits and drawbacks to itchfunding in the context of their project.

## What Programs To Use?
There are a ton of fantastic programs one can use when writing and designing games. Below are what I used to make Liminal Horror.
- [Free Graphic Design Resources & Best Practices For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/free-graphic-design-resources-and-best-practices-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This post gives a great overview of the different aspects of design (from programs you can use, to different ways of building your skils, to important things to consider when working with others' work).
- [Resources for Free Creation Tools](https://itch.io/c/1832904/resources-for-free-creation-tools) by G. Raven Image is a collection of tools housed on itch.io that can help in various aspects of the writing, designing, and publishing process.

### Markdown
I've found myself writing my games using markdown (an easy to use computer language) that can be used with a variety of different programs, and allows you to output in multiple formats (pdf, epub, html). This increases your ability to create dynamic and accessible products down the line.
- [Using Markdown and Pandoc to Make RPG Documents for Free](https://lukegearing.blot.im/using-markdown-and-pandoc-to-make-rpg-documents-for-free) by Luke Gearing is a fantastic step by step guide on how to write in markdown and then publish the results in multiple formats.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a super easy to learn writing program that I use regualrly. When paired with [pandoc](https://support.typora.io/Install-and-Use-Pandoc/) it gives you a lot of built in output options as well. It is what I used to write and publish the [Liminal Horror epub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10f8Q4jC3yQdbTUKx1DqIaHXEkdBWw-Cg/view?usp=sharing) (with some minor backend editing in calibre).
- [Zine Month 2022 Contribution - How to use Markdown and Pandoc to publish zines.](https://underwaterowlbear.blot.im/zine-month-2022-contribution-how-to-use-markdown-and-pandoc-to-publish-zines) is a fantastic guide in how to use markdown (and the pandoc extension) to publish your zines. The end result is a printable booklet ready to be made into a zine (and a format that can easily be exported to epub).
- [Making an HTML Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ2w36wJi0&ab_channel=NateTreme) by Nate Treme is a great overview of the type of unique projects that are possible with markdown. An HTML dungeon that you can post right onto itch.io!
- [Spongedown](https://ivanceras.github.io/spongedown/Spongedown.html) is a wraps of markdown that allows you to integrate interesting diagrams, shapes, graphs, flowcharts, comics into your work.
- [Svgbob](https://ivanceras.github.io/svgbob-editor/) is a diagramming model that lets you create shaped in your markdown files.
- [mermaid - Markdownish syntax for generating flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, gantt charts and git graphs.](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

## Create your own SRD
Creating your own online SRD is not only a way to present your work (creating a free web based, public facing document that allows for collaboration and growth) but can help structure the writing and end product.
- [A Step-by-Step Guide to creating a TTRPG SRD](https://gist.github.com/Gulluth/447fe732d9681685ab01d7c512376b73) by Desolate Drifter [@GulluthGultch](https://twitter.com/GulluthGulch) is a comprehensve guide to creating your very ownn TTRPG SRD (that is also free).

### Character Sheets
- [How to Design TTRPG Sheets with Google Sheets](https://twitter.com/momatoes/status/1434902519335981065?s=20) by Momatoes is their guide on how to create a phenomenal and unique character sheet with google sheets.
- [Video Stream: teaching google sheets](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1139349790) by Momatoes takes you through the process of creating a character sheet like the one made for ARC.
- [Slide Deck: Google Sheets for fun, design, and games](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mj27yqx7kimxx2c/Google%20Sheets%20for%20fun%20design%20and%20games.pdf?dl=0) by Momatoes is the slide deck that was used in the stream and acts as a great reference.

### Word Processors/File Organization
- **Markdown** based programs such as [typora](https://typora.io/) or [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) are great options. I would highly recommend taking a little bit of time to learn about this option since it can really open up some opportunities at the end of your project.
- **Google Drive** for file organization & management. [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire) goes into detail about how one can leverage google docs to create a finished ttrpg. It presents what went well using gdocs, and what the drawbacks were.
- **Google Docs** for writing the base text of Limnial Horror. This also allowed me to share the document and recieve notes/feedback.

### Layout
- [Affinity Publisher](affinity.serif.com). This is an affordable, single purchase program.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a free website that really scaffolds small scale design in a way that allows anyone to create professional products. It is used a ton in teaching and other fields. A great overview by Jeeyon Shim, on how to use it in ttrpg spaces, can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20)

Here is a list of alternatives to Adobe programs created by [xdaniel Art](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt) (they require a regular subscription that is predatory and if you don't pay you often get hit with massive hidden fees and lose access to things you have made/bought) <br>

Having a good font and layout is vital toward making your game engaging to read/use. Here are some resources I found to help learn about layout/design.
- Johan Nohr (one of the designers of MÖRK BORG, which pushes the layout and typeface envelope) wrote two must read threads on choosing a typeface and setting a body text. These dives are worth reading if you have any interest in design and are a great way to start your journey.
  - [Choosing a typeface](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1275739369735929856?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr.
  - [Setting a body text](https://twitter.com/JohanNohr/status/1276532452627034112?s=20), a twitter thread by Johan Nohr. 

## Layout
- [Designing Layouts (Layout and the Grid)](https://www.theexplorersco.com/home/2019/7/20/exploring-layout) by Clayton Notestine. This was the single most helpful resource in my learning how to do layout for my game. Not only does Clayton go over the core concepts of layout, but he goes on to give annotated examples of TTRPGs and their layout. 100/10 recomend.
- [Layout Design Tips For Your Next TTRPG Project](https://ghostlorestudios.com/layout-design-tips-for-your-next-ttrpg-project/) by Ghost Lore. This is the final entry in a series that gives a good progression of layout tips that is well worth reading prior to starting the layout of your project.
- [Why Is Layout Important in Graphic Design?](https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/why-is-layout-important-in-graphic-design) by Stephanie Corrigan is a great overview of layout prinicples with visual examples to reinforce concepts.
- [Using Canva to layout your ttrpg](https://twitter.com/jeeyonshim/status/1432987328247521284?s=20) by Jeeyon Shim is a fantastic thread on how to leverage a great design tool to create small games. They look great and result in a quality that supports any new designer. Jeeyon is extremely thorough in their step by step guide in this thread. Well worth considering for your next project.
- [Pamplet RPG Template For Affinity Publisher](https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/wtf-pamphlet-rpg-template-affinity-publisher) by wizardthieffighter (writer of the awe inspiring Ultra Violet Grasslands). This template will get you all set up for writnig your own pamphlet using Affinity Publisher (a great single payment layout software...Adobe makes you pay monthly)
- **Pinterest**: Look up layout, design, zines on pinterest to see examples of different design ideas you can use. This helps build visual references for the kind of things that are possible.

## Typography & Fonts

This blog is about utilizing different fonts for coding and could easily be applicable when thinking about what typeface to use for your project (especially if monospaced type aligns to the aesthetic of your project). Be sure to check the licensing of any fonts you are interested in to make sure they are available for commercial use.

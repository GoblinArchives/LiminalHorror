## FUNDING
While you can write and create each aspect of your zine yourself, some parts may require funds to complete (either to make a reality or to commission someone to make). Some things that may require investment are:
- Art
- Writing
- Editing
- Layout
- Design
- Publishing

Other than self funding (or getting someone to invest/partner), there are are a few different ways to raise funds for your game. A noncomprehensive list is:
- setting up a co-op
- slowfunding
- settig up pre-orders
- "crowdfunding" platforms (such as itchfunding or Gamefound).

### itchfunding
An alternative to Kickstarter that is newer (but avoids many of the issues with kickstarter) is itchfunding. This is the format I curretly am using to create [The Mall](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall).
- [Jalopy Design: Itchfunding & Gdocs](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/11/jalopyitchgdocs) by David Schirduan (Technical Grimoire). As with all the Jalopy Design entries, this one is extremely infomrative in providing a deep look at the benefits and drawbacks to itchfunding in the context of their project.
- [Information Thread: How To Setup Itchfunding!](https://twitter.com/PandionGames/status/1494418829610561536?s=20&t=zmv6zm7LLIMzcs6-3zLWbw) by Pandion Games is a fantastic 16 tweet thread that goes over the benefits and steps crowdfund using itchfunding.
- [Itchfund FAQ](https://itchfunding.games/#faq) by KeganExe is a great place to get an overview of what itchfunding is and what it can do.
PlusOneEXP hosted a great discussion on Itchfunding.
- [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clNyEWtF1Yo&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Jeff Stormer
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FJiCCoe5c&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with KeganExe, Adam Bell, Nic Masyk
- [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpsOqZ4sAWU&ab_channel=PlusOneExp) is with Thomas Manuel & Sam Leigh.
- [Google Doc compiling notes on the discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MW7uZ2LS2BHGA2bZlZ9LwgCSzVZAVhzeHF4crxtUeQU/edit#heading=h.s68hu2kptye4) by EldritchMouse.
- [The Mall itchfunding page](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/the-mall) is an example of an itchfunding page. I used a ton of different models and the above resources to try and structure it in a way that presented the necessary information to backers. You can use any parts of it (especially the Itchfunding & the Mall, The Goal, and the Logistics sections) in your own campaign.

### Presale Model
Another funding method being implemented is a pre-sale model
- [My Adventures In Selling Stuff Part 2: How I turned a free BigCartel shop into my personal crowdunding platform](https://twitter.com/seanpatrickcain/status/1445783558925086733?s=20) by Sean Patrick Cain is one twitter thread (in a fantastic series) that goes step by step in how to use the free version of BigCartel to make a pre-order funding platform.
- [Craigstarter](https://github.com/cmod/craigstarter) by Craig Mod is a free to us/edit/extend crowdfunding tool for Shopify.

### Slowfunding
Slowfunding is crowdfunding alternative proposed by Long Tail Games, that acts gradual model of colecting pre-orders over an extended period of time, and once it hit pre-determined markers then it triggers going into different stages of production.
- [Slowfund launch announcement for Lost Eons](https://twitter.com/Long_Tail_Games/status/1470729086850912257?s=20) goes into the idea behind slowfunding.

### Printing Partnerships
One option is to partner with retailers to help fund a print run. Many online retailers do this (I have experience partnering with Exalted Funeral and Space Penguin Ink).

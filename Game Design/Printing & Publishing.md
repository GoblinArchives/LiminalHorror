## Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).

## Printing & Publishing
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.

## Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.

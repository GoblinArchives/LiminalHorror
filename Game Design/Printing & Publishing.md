This is a great peak behind the curtain on some of the realities of self publishing.

## Selling PDFs Of Your Game
If you are selling your digital game, two major market places for selling digital games are [itch.io](https://itch.io/) as a physical game (yes, ttrpgs are tagged as physical games even though they are PDFs) or on [drivethrurpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/).

## Printing & Publishing (Yourself)
So you've put your game on itch or drivethru and you want to get a print run going. Here are some resources that can help guide you in the right direction.
- [So You Want to Make a Zine: Printing](https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) by Mazirian's Garden expands on the different ways you can print a zine (use a copy machine, print at home, print at a print shop, print through an online printer).
- [Indie Game Publishing Resources](https://lonearchivist.com/indie-game-publishing-resources) by Lone Archivist collects many different avenues you could use for getting your game into print.
- [The Printing Process Demystified For TTRPG Creators](https://ghostlorestudios.com/the-printing-process-demystified-for-ttrpg-creators/) by Ghost Lore. This helpful guide goes over the different aspects of printing.
- [ISBN Barcode Generator](https://kindlepreneur.com/isbn-bar-code-generator/) allows you to create ISBN barcodes for your products (which is necessary to be carried in many brick and mortar stores).

## Printing Options
There are a few different options in terms of printers that you can use. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but is a place to start.
- [Mixam](https://mixam.com/zines) is probably the most common/popular way to print physical ttrpg zines.
- [Tabletop Hotdish](https://twitter.com/TabletopHotdish/status/1456727136761524235?s=20) is a newer small business printer who has been working with indie zine publishers (and does free print proofs). Currently they are launching a full website, but dm on twitter to see about starting a partnership.
- [short Run Printing](https://www.shortrunprinting.com/)
- [Jukebox](https://www.jukeboxprint.com/booklets) is another web based printer that offers a ton of different formats (stickers, booklets, brochures, etc). Often seen as a good mixam alternative.
- [Spencer Printing](http://spencerprinting.com/) offers both offset & digital printing, as well as short-run book printing.
- [Taylor Specialty Books](http://taylorspecialtybooks.com/)
- [Smartpress](https://smartpress.com/)
- [Pet Riso Studio](https://www.petrisostudio.com/) is a US based risograph printer.
- [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/sell/sell-on-lulu) allows you to upload your print files and sell print on demand either through their platform or your own store.

## Publishing Partnerships
One option for funding a print run is to partner with a publisher/distributor. Many indie storefronts regularly partner with game writers to get a finished game to print. This tends to involve a partnership where the store fronts some (or all) of the cost to print. Afterwards they handle distribution, and after the print costs are recouped they pay regular royalties to the game's designer. This is the avenue I went through for Liminal Horror (I had it published through Exalted Funeral Press).
- If publishing it yourself is out of reach (logistically or financially), it is worthwhile to reach out to one of the great small ttrpg retailers listed below. Sometimes all it takes is emailing the right person to make a connection that can help you get into print.


## Selling You Game
One option for selling your printed game is to sell it yourself (on your website, as an add-on on itch, or using some other platform). The other option is to try and get some of the fantastic online sellers to carry it. This means reaching out to their buyers. Below are some different sites that sell ttrpg zines along with where they are based out of. If they are located in a different country, it may be benefitial to coordinate with them about doing a print run near them to cut down on international shipping.
- [Setting up Shopify for Wholesale](https://pandiongames.notion.site/Setting-up-Shopify-Wholesale-88000e81e0654ad798de5245f427649e) by Pandiongames.

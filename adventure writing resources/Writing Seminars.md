We have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to host a few horror writing seminars and talks.

## Adapting A Mystery: Liminal Horror Writing Seminar
Josh Domanski and Goblin Archives did a horror writing seminar on The Weekly Scroll. This was aimed at providing advice on how to adapt a work into an adventure for Liminal Horror. In itâ€™s truest essence, the core tenets presented can be generalized to writing any type of adventure (adaptation or original concepts) into modern horror/Liminal Horror.

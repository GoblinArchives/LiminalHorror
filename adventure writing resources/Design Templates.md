# Liminal Horror Design Templates
![image](/img/template.png)

**Overcome the horrors of having to do your own layout with these design templates for Liminal Horror!**

Even when the prose flows freely and the horrors in your mind are unleashed onto the page, getting your grotesque creatures and tension filled scenarios into a format that's useable for other folks can be a challenge. This template is meant to help lower that barrier, giving you the bones to work off of, so you can focus on the more important pieces of your project.

Currently this template is in a barebones form for [Affinity 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/?mc=AFFPPC01,UGC-PUB-PMAX&co=US&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxsm3BhDrARIsAMtVz6PP6-R3RxIO3tsOoejeZU4yXPxb799ZQ6_waPlXFl4sO9u4tlzLBxUaAhI6EALw_wcB) and was designed to support the Horrors of the Americas game jam for Liminal Horror. A more robust template, include files for additional programs like InDesign, will be developed at a later date.

## What's Included?
This preliminary template is setup for US Trade (6"x9") documents, though making alterations to support the smaller Half-Letter size zine is a breeze. Included are basic starting templates for scenarios, creatures, factions, stat blocks, artifacts, NPCs, tables, and plot hooks. **Each of these also comes with advice on the type of things you should keep in mind as you're writing.**

## What Can I Do With This?
This template is yours to do with as you please. The includes typefaces are available for free commercial use under Google Fonts and there are no unlicensed art assets to be concerned with. Add in your own assets, change the design, pick your own typefaces, or get a little avant-garde with it. The template is just here to give you a simple foundation to begin building off of.

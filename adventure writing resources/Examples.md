# Examples Using The Design Templates
![image](/img/examples.png)

Josh Domanski created some exemplars using the [Liminal Horror Design Templates](https://unenthuser.itch.io/liminal-horror-design-templates).

Case Files are short-form resources for Liminal Horror. These may be factions, creatures, short adventures, Resonant Artifacts, or locations to investigate. These are designed to be quick to pull out and bring to the table, either for a single session of play or to bolster an ongoing campaign.

**Volume 1: Blood Moon includes the following:**

- **The Hermetic Order of the Crimson Moon:** An antiquated faction dedicated to the study of occult and paranormal, though only one member is still alive.
- **Second Dawn:** A coven of vampyre lifestylers who believe they have transcended and become real vampires, leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake. Includes both the faction and a short scenario.
- **Jolene:** An eldritch seductress.

Volume 1: Blood Moon was written to support the [Horrors of the Americas jam](https://itch.io/jam/horror-of-the-americas-jam) for Liminal Horror.

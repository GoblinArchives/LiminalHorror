# Localization Guide
Although the Liminal Horror rules exist in many forms (PDF, Google Docs, Word, etc), the [SRD](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/SRD/) is probably the best choice for ease of translation. Not only is it all in one place, but it is the version of the rules that is licensed [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) which will make it the easiest to translate and create with.

## Translating the SRD
1. Copy the [SRD Markdown](https://github.com/GoblinArchives/LiminalHorror/blob/gh-pages/SRD.md) (click Raw) to a markdown editor such as [Typora](https://typora.com/) or a web-based renderer like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/). If you know how to use Git, you can use [Atom](https://cairnrpg.com/localizations/localization-guide/atom.io). If you don’t know markdown, don’t worry! It’s easy. Read more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
2. Do the hard work of translating the core document. Google Translate and deepl.com are good resources; you can even simply translate the entire document once, then look through it for corrections.

**Note:** While the [SRD](https://liminalhorrorrpg.com/SRD/) is licesnsed [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), Zach Hazard Vaupen's cover art is not. If you are looking to release using the art you must contact him to license it ([zachhazardvaupen@gmail.com](zachhazardvaupen@gmail.com)), or create your own custom cover for the translation.

## Adapting A Mystery: Liminal Horror Writing Seminar
Josh Domanski and Goblin Archives did a horror writing seminar on The Weekly Scroll. This was aimed at providing advice on how to adapt a work into an adventure for Liminal Horror. In it’s truest essence, the core tenets presented can be generalized to writing any type of adventure (adaptation or original concepts) into modern horror/Liminal Horror.
